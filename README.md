# Hello World

Hi there. I'm ***Saptarshi C*** and I'm a *former* *Website Developer* from somewhere in ***India***.

My educational background is as a *Computer Science Engineer* and I have a Bachelor's degree in it. Still, I would consider myself a mostly self-taught web developer.

I have done freelance web development from 2011 onwards, up until the middle of 2020. Then I went on to become a *Technical Support* person for one of my previous clients during the pandemic days; helping them with conducting and managing their online classes. This ended in the middle of 2022.

My primary web development expertise is in making websites using *Joomla* as a back-end with custom-coded front-end templates. I have also dabbled in using *CodeIgniter* and even made my own website using a plain PHP based system.

I always wanted to get into doing Game Development, and to that end, I have also studied ***3D Art and Animation*** way back in the day from 2009 to 2011. This never panned out at the time, but Iâ€™m still glad that I learnt it. In 2022, I learnt how to use the Unity game engine and C# to make games, and, in 2023, have done an internship as a Game Developer. I have since left the internship because there does not seem to be much actual work for someone my age in the game industry, and the industry itself seems to be on fire at the moment.

I am currently re-learning 3D Art & Animation using *Blender* on my own with the aim of hopefully working either full time or freelance in the entertainment sector.

In my free time you will find my watching gaming streams or learning more game development stuff, such as learning more Unity with C#, and now Godot with GDScript and C# as well.

I much appreciate your time, and since you managed to make it this far, here's my cat, who has, sadly, passed away in 2023:
